👋🏻😊 Hi there,

I'm a data student who wants to be a Data Analyst in the near future.

I love to analyze data sets, discover new things, manipulate them, build reports and share helpful information with the community and my coworkers.

I started this journeys when I discovered that Excel isn't enough to do all the analyzes that I want. Since then, I started to learn programming logic, Python, SQL and some graphic tools to present data like Google Data Studios and Power BI.

I know that I'm new to this world and have a lot to learn. Because of that I decided to open this Git repository to share my studies and challenges about what I'm learning. 

💭 "It's all about the journey" 💭


🏢 I'm currently working on Shopee

📚 I'm currently learning SQL, Python, Power BI
